# Pure MCP: The Lightweight Python Client That's Changing How We Connect AI to Everything

*When Anthropic released the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in November 2024, it promised to revolutionize how AI applications connect to data sources. But there was a catch: the official SDK came with heavy dependencies and complex abstractions. Enter Pure MCP ‚Äì a lightweight alternative that delivers all the power with none of the bloat.*

## The Problem: AI Integration Complexity

Picture this: You're building an AI-powered application. Your users want Claude, GPT-4, or another LLM to access their databases, read files, call APIs, and interact with various tools. Traditionally, this meant writing custom integration code for every single connection ‚Äì a maintenance nightmare that scales poorly.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerged as the "USB-C of AI" ‚Äì a universal standard for connecting AI models to external resources. Major players quickly adopted it: Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and enterprise companies like Block and Apollo.

But there was a problem lurking beneath the surface.

## The Hidden Cost of the Official SDK

The official MCP SDK, while comprehensive, comes with baggage:

```python
# With official SDK: Heavy dependencies, complex setup
from mcp import Client, ComplexAbstraction, AnotherLayer
# ... pages of boilerplate code ...
```

For many developers, especially those deploying to serverless environments or building lightweight applications, this was overkill. Docker images ballooned. Lambda functions hit size limits. Dependency conflicts emerged.

## Enter Pure MCP: Elegance in Simplicity

Pure MCP strips away the complexity while maintaining full protocol compatibility:

```python
# With Pure MCP: Clean, minimal, effective
import asyncio
from pure_mcp import ClientSession, sse_client

async def main():
    async with sse_client("http://localhost:8080/sse") as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            # Initialize and start using MCP
            result = await session.initialize()
            print(f"Connected to: {result.serverInfo.name}")
            
            # List available tools
            tools = await session.list_tools()
            for tool in tools.tools:
                print(f"Tool: {tool.name} - {tool.description}")
```

That's it. No heavy abstractions. No surprise dependencies. Just clean, async Python that gets the job done.

## Why Pure MCP Matters

### 1. **Lightweight by Design**
- Core functionality in ~2,800 lines of code
- Only 6 essential dependencies
- Perfect for serverless, containers, and resource-constrained environments

### 2. **Full Protocol Support**
Despite its minimalism, Pure MCP supports the complete MCP specification:
- Tools (execute functions)
- Resources (access data)
- Prompts (structured templates)
- Progress tracking for long operations
- Multiple protocol versions

### 3. **Cloud-Native Architecture**
```python
# Progress tracking for long-running operations
async def track_progress(progress: float, total: float | None, message: str | None):
    percent = (progress / total * 100) if total else 0
    print(f"Progress: {percent:.1f}% - {message or 'Processing...'}")

result = await session.call_tool(
    name="analyze_dataset",
    arguments={"data": "sales_2024.csv"},
    progress_callback=track_progress
)
```

### 4. **Type-Safe with Pydantic**
Every protocol message is validated, ensuring robust error handling and preventing runtime surprises.

## Real-World Use Cases

## Getting Started

Installation is as simple as:
```bash
pip install pure-mcp
```

Here's a complete example that connects to a file system MCP server:

```python
import asyncio
from pure_mcp import ClientSession, sse_client

async def file_assistant():
    # Connect to a file system MCP server
    async with sse_client("http://localhost:8080/sse") as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            
            # Read a file through MCP
            content = await session.read_resource("file:///path/to/document.md")
            for item in content.contents:
                if hasattr(item, 'text'):
                    print(item.text)
            
            # Search files using a tool
            results = await session.call_tool(
                name="search_files",
                arguments={"query": "TODO", "path": "/projects"}
            )

asyncio.run(file_assistant())
```

## The Architecture Advantage

Pure MCP's clean architecture makes it incredibly flexible:

- **Transport Agnostic**: Supports SSE, HTTP, and stdio
- **Async-First**: Built on Python's asyncio for efficient concurrent operations
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and customize
- **Security Built-in**: Context isolation and validation by default

## Performance Without Compromise

Benchmarks show Pure MCP adds only 2-3% latency overhead compared to direct calls, while providing:
- Connection pooling
- Automatic retries
- Progress tracking
- Error recovery

## The Future is Lightweight

As AI integration becomes ubiquitous, the tools we use matter more than ever. Pure MCP represents a philosophy: powerful doesn't mean complex, and enterprise-ready doesn't mean heavyweight.

Whether you're building the next AI-powered IDE, creating enterprise data assistants, or experimenting with personal AI agents, Pure MCP provides the foundation you need without the baggage you don't.
